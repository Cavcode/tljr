-Added command completion, which pops up menus to assist the user when a command or emote is entered
    incorrectly (Linux only).
-Added a Command Targeter, to allow much greater freedom in targeting commands. They may still be
    targeted via tell, but if they are not, the user will be prompted to target by either using the
    Command Targeter or by sending a tell with the !target command.
-Added a channel muting option for silenced characters.
-SIMTools now utilzes a new nwx plugin, nwnx_events by Virusman, which allows users to hook events
    like onattacked, onpickpocket, and more. It also allows detection of conversation node #s via
    script, greatly reducing the number of scripts required for conversations (Linux only).

V2.1
-Colored language text is now correctly translated.
-PROCESS_NPC_SPEECH option now set to TRUE by default. It must be on to prevent
    PCs from evading the ignore feature by possessing their familars.
-Added levels to party list in playerinfo.
-Fixed a bug allowing evasion of talking while dead blocks with the emote symbol.
-You can now speak languages in Whisper.

V2.0
-Added an option to redirect chat from languages, metachannels, and message fowarding to the chat log
    instead of the combat log. This results in a green [Tell] box before text, but prevents the messages
    from being lost from combat scrolling. The ootion is turned on, by default. Thanks to virusman and
    dumbo for the new functionality!
-Moved the NPC listening switch from the ini file to the configuration script, for easier access.
    Thanks to dumbo for the improved functionality!
-Added an option to disable tracking of silent channels while still processing NPC speech, which will
    cut down on scriptcalls but still allows DMs possessing NPCs to have their speech processed. Thanks
    to both dumbo and virusman for the new option!
-Fixed some minor typos introduced in version 1.4.

V1.4
-Added dozens of emotes, based on dmfi emotes, with two-letter shortcuts for most.
-Modified emote handling so that other messages beginning with the emote symbol would not show as
    invalid emotes, unless they were in shout channel. This will allow people to use the * prefix
    for emote commands an still allow normal use of *-prefixed emote sentences, which seemed like
    a more natural setup than forcing a different emote symbol.
-Added a silent lore check option for language recognition and comprehension checks, included in a
    modified GetIsSkillSuccessful function because GISS was bugged in 1.67 Linux.
-Added a switch in the nwnx_ini file to allow processing of npc messages, which allows dms possessing
    npcs to have their speech processed. Credit to dumbo and virusman for the added functionality!
    The switch is off by default. To turn it on, just remove the ; from before the ;processnpc=1 line
    to uncomment it and have SIMTools process NPC speech, and then save.
-Added an escape string option. Adding it to the beginning of the string in a SpeakString call will
    prevent the speaker from translating the string if they are in 'speak another language' mode. It's
    useful for text you don't ever want to be translated, like loot notification messsages. You can set
    it to whatever string you want, of whatever length, so long as it does not begin with your command
    symbol (default is !), your emote symbol (default is *), or the forward slash channel designator (/).
    It should only be used for TALKVOLUME_TALK SpeakStrings, as they are the only volume subject to
    translation.
-Added the nwnx reset plugin and a dm command to reset the server from ingame, dm_reset. Unlike
    calling StartNewModule, the reset plugin stops the nwserver process, clearing the memory to
    eliminate lag buildup.
-Added !d4 and !d10 commands to complete the dice set.
-Updated the playerinfo command to provide more information.
-Added the anon command to hide some of the information given by the playerinfo command, and the unanon
    command to remove anonymous status.
-Corrected the description of the metakick command.
-Added dm commands to award and remove experience and levels: dm_givexp, dm_givelevel, dm_takexp,
    and dm_takelevel.
-Minor bugfix to allow subraces to give characters multiple languages.
-Moved all the strings in the scriptset to a const file to make the task of translating them into other
    languages simpler. If anyone does take the time to translate the whole file, please send it to me so
    I can add it to the scriptset.

V1.3
-Added 39 new languages, provided by Lanessar and the players of the Myth Drannor PW.
-Added the DM Voice Thrower item, to tag objects for use with the ventrilo command. The current script
    uses tag-based scripting, but can easily be converted if you use a single onactivate script. Switch to
    tag-based already! :P
-Added 9 new DM commands:
    /v - (the ventrilo command) when ever you enter this channel prefix, the speech you type is spoken by
        the object you tagged with the DM Voice Thrower Item instead. Works on PCs, creatures, items,
        placeables, and so on. Lots of fun, and a potential mischiefmaker!
    dm_change_appear - sets target appearance to the specified appearance constant (ala the console command)
    dm_change_appear base - restores target appearance (only works with 1- NWNX or 2- Bioware DB with
        languages enabled)
    dm_fx - applys any vfx in the game, at any duration, to the target
    dm_fx_loc - applys any vfx in the game, at any duration, to the target's location
    dm_fx_rem - removes all vfx applied by the sender of the tell to the target
    dm_fx_list_* -lists vfx name and numbers by type, lith 6 types: dur, bea, eye, imp, com, fnf
    dm_learn - teaches the target a specified language
    dm_unlearm - removes knowledge from the target of the specified language
-Added 6 new scripting commands:
    !list languages - lists all the languages the player can speak
    !list alllanguages - lists all the available languages SIMTools has to offer
    !setname - sets an item matching the name input in the speakers inventory to the new name input
    !setname all - same as setname but switches all items of that name
    !skillcheck - does a skillcheck for the player for the specified skill and dc
    !list skills - lists the skill names and numbers for easy input into the skillcheck

V1.2
-Added DMFI languages! Characters may now speak all the languages from the DMFI scriptset, either with
  one-liner commands or via on/off toggles. Their typing appears as the language selected, and their listeners
  (in either talk or party channels) get lore checks to either 1) comprehend the speech if they don't
  know it (optional) or 2) to recognize what language it is. Characters will gain languages on levelup,
  if they add a language-speaking class, and may learn additional languages if you choose to allow it.
  There is a sample language teacher in the test mod provided as an example of how to add languages to PCs.
-Added the dm_create command, so that DMs can create items specified by resrefs.
-Fixed a bug with dm_unbanshout that was leaving characters banned again after a reset.

V1.1
-Added an admin designation with seperate (and potentially greater) powers than the dm designation.
  This may create a little confusion, because 'DM' is now a distinct designation, as well as describing
  whether the person is logged in using the DM client. To summarize, the system has 4 potential sets
  of persons who it treats distinctly:
  ---
  People listed in the VerifyDMKey function (or 'designated DMs') who are logged in with DM client - DMDMs
  People listed in the VerifyDMKey function (or 'designated DMs') who are logged in with PC client - DMPCs
  People listed in the VerifyAdminKey function (or 'designated admins') who are logged in with DM client - AdminDMs
  People listed in the VerifyAdminKey function (or 'designated admins') who are logged in with PC client - ADminPCs
  ---
  You need not know these designations, but they may help clarify the toggles below.
-Added the ability to designate your own emote and command prefix symbols, instead of '*' and '!'.
-Fixed the dm_ignoremeta command. It was unimplemented (oops).
-Fixed the TOWN destination, it was set to JAIL.
-Now only DMs are given the target's ip with the !playerinfo command. Security concerns.
-Broke the disable speech on death option down by channel, so that players acan still use some channels,
  and added the option to prevent use of metachannel while dead.
-Cleaned up the main function using wrapper functions, to make the structure clearer, and optimized it a bit.

const int USING_LINUX = FALSE;//Set this to TRUE if you are using Linux instead of Windows. The Linux version of the
//chat plugin has some added functionality which allows popup conversations with command completion when a command
//or emote is misentered.

const int USING_NWNX_DB = TRUE;//Set this to TRUE if you are using NWNX/APS persistence ints. Leave
//it set to FALSE otherwise, or if you are unsure what this means. The persistence ints in these scripts
//use the default APS database and columns, so if you did not customize your MySQL/MySQLite database they are
//ready to use.

const int PROCESS_NPC_SPEECH = TRUE;//Leave this set this to TRUE if you want speech from NPCs to be processed through SIMTools.
//This means that all channels (including silent channels) will be monitored. It is useful for processing the speech
//of DMs possesssing NPCs. It's also necessary if you want to prevent avoidance of the ignore function by PCs possessing
//their familiars. The only downside is the increased number of scriptcalls generated, but the effect on performance should
//not be noticeable.

const int IGNORE_SILENT_CHANNELS = TRUE;//This switch turns off processing of silent channel speech if you have chosen to
//process NPC speech with the PROCESS_NPC_SPEECH speech above. This is important because monsters communicate across
//the entire module using the silent channels, and processing them could result in a greatly increased number of
//scriptcalls. You should only set this switch to FALSE if you plan to add to the functionality of SIMTools in a way
//that requires processing of silent channels. The current SIMTools scripts do not rely on processing silent channels
//at all, and DMs possessing NPCs will still have their speech processed with IGNORE_SILENT_CHANNELS set to TRUE.

const int TEXT_LOGGING_ENABLED = TRUE;//Set to TRUE to send all messages to the text log.

const int SPAMBLOCK_ENABLED = TRUE;//Set this to FALSE to turn off spam blocker. It is intended to

const string EMOTE_SYMBOL = "*";//Set this to whatever single character you want players to access the emotes
//with. It is recommended that you select only a normally unused symbol, because any line beginning with this
//symbol will be seen by the system as an attempted emote, and suppressed accordingly (with an 'invalid emote'
//warning if they aren't among the listed emotes). ONLY A SINGLE CHARACTER MAY BE USED. Do not choose the
//forward slash (/), or metachannels and languages will not work. You may simply choose to use the default
//asterisk symbol, if you prefer. If you select a symbol other than the asterisk, the list commands and list
//emotes functions will display the correct symbol automatically, but you will have to change the descriptions
//of the 2 command list items to reflect the change, if you plan to use them and want them to be accurate.

const string COMMAND_SYMBOL = "!";//Set this to whatever single character you want players to access the
//commands with. It is recommended that you select only a normally unused symbol, because any line beginning
//with this symbol will be seen by the system as an attempted emote, and suppressed accordingly (with an
//'invalid emote' warning if they aren't among the listed emotes). ONLY A SINGLE CHARACTER MAY BE USED. YOU
//MUST PICK A DIFFERENT SYMBOL THAN THE ONE YOU CHOOSE FOR EMOTES, OR THE COMMANDS WILL NOT WORK. Do not
//choose the forward slash (/), or metachannels will not work. You may simply choose to use the default
//exclamation mark symbol, if you prefer. If you select a symbol other than the exclamation mark, the list commands
//and list emotes functions will display the correct symbol automatically, but you will have to change the
//descriptions of the 2 command list items to reflect the change, if you plan to use them and want them to be accurate.

const int ENABLE_WEAPON_VISUALS = FALSE;//Set this to TRUE to allow players to change the vfx on their weapons
//via the !wp commands.

const int ENABLE_PLAYER_SETNAME = FALSE;//Set this to TRUE to allow players to use the !setname command.

const int ENABLE_PLAYER_SETTAILWINGS = FALSE;//Set this to TRUE to allow players to use the !settail and !setwings commands.

const int ENABLE_METALANGUAGE_CONVERSION = FALSE;//Set this to FALSE to stop common metagame chat like 'lol'
//from being converted to emotes like *Laughs out loud* when spoken in the talk channel. Currently only 'lol'
//is converted, more will be added.

/////////////////////////////////Message Routing////////////////////////////////

const int SEND_CHANNELS_TO_CHAT_LOG = TRUE;//Set this to FALSE if you want languages, listening, and metachannels
//sent to the combat log instead of the chat log. This will elimimate the [Tell] bracketed text in front of messages

//////////////////////////////////Metachannels//////////////////////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Metachannels are added chat channels. They are very similar to the party channel, in that players
//control who is in their metachannel via invites. They may invite whomever they like, however, and
//are not limited to the members of their party. There is no set number of metachannels; rather, a
//metachannel is created whenever a player wants. The first invite sent out determines who the 'leader'
//of the metachannel is. When that invite is accepted, the inviter becomes the leader of a new metachannel.
//From that point on, any messages that any member types that begin with '/m' will be sent to every member
//of the metachannel, via the combat log. Metachannels will be logged with other text if you enable
//text logging. If you are uncertain what use these channels could be put to, the whole reason that I

//from his race and a second from his subrace. Leetspeak is included only for purposes of completeness. If
//you modify subrace names after creation you will have to 'teach' the character the appropriate language
//when you do, because these are only checked the first time a character enters the server. An example
//language teacher conversation is included in the demo module. If you have disabled languages you may
