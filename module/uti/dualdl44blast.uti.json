It was outlawed by the Empire because of this. As a side effect, however, it has a somewhat slow rate of fire and uses about four times as much energy as a standard blaster, exhausting its magazine in about 50 shots. It weighs about 1.3 kg. A unique feature of the DL-44 is the vibration system built into the handgrip. A small stud in the grip begins to pulse gently to alert the user when the weapon's remaining energy is sufficient for five shots or fewer."
