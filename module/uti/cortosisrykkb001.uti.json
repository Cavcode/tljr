This is traditionally put into swords or other melee weapons but could also be fashioned into armor or other gear. Cortosis weave is employed primarily because it made the weapon able to withstand lightsaber blows. Weapons needs very little cortosis to be effective but armor requires a substantially larger amount. The greater quantity provides an additional benefit to wearers though- a lightsaber would deactivate after contact is made with cortosis armor. Cortosis is extremely rare though and, thus, extremely expensive, resulting in few weapons and armor made with it."

The design of these weapons vary greatly between individuals, but all Ryyk Blades are hand-constructed and are considered an extension of the wielder, much like the Wookiee relationship with their Bowcasters. The average weight of a Ryyk was around fifteen kilograms, but Wookiees could wield them with surprising speed and grace. \n\nThe blade was first developed when the Wookiees were still technologically primitive; they were used for clearing paths through the thick forests of Kashyyyk and fending off vicious predators. Ryyk blades were used heavily by Trandoshan slavers during the Clone Wars and currently, by Wookiee Berserkers during the Galactic Civil War."
