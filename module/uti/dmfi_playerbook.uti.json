The basic structure is to use the DM channel to \"hide\" the throwing of your voice.  There is NO way to not spam the DM channel.\n\n/dm [your typing here]\n\nwill speak your \"native\" language.  If you have more than one, use the language widgets to determine the language you will be speaking.\n\n/dm ; your text here\n\nYour familiar or companion will say your text.\n\n/dm ,your text here\n\nYour summoned creature will say your text.\n\n\n*emotes*\n--------------\nBracketing text between two * will attempt to perform an emote.  This does NOT need to use the DM channel.  This applies to simple spoken text by the PC.\n\nThis will work for DM possessed creatures or for players.  The action will be taken by the speaker.\n\nTwo uses:  \n\n1) is for skill checks or ability checks - ie *uses strength to move rock*\n\n2) is for emotes - ie *bows to the leader of the town*\n\nAppropriate actions include:\n\nAll abilities and all skills (spell them just like the actual skill or ability - ie use magic device)\n\nEmote animations:\n\nagree\nbeg, plead\nbends, stoops\nbored, scratch\nbow\ncantrip\ncheer, hooray, celebrate\ndemand, threaten\ndrink , sip\ndrunk, woozy\nducks, dodge\nfall back\nfiddle\nfidget, shift\nflop, prone\ngiggle\ngreet\nhum\nlaugh, chuckle\nnap\nnod\npeers, scans\npray, meditate\nread\nsalute\nsearch\nshakes head\nsing\nsit\nsits on floor or ground\nsmokes\nsnore\nspasm\nspellcast\nsteal\nswipe\ntalks, chats\ntaunt, mock\ntired, fatigue, exhausted\nwave\nwhistles\nworship\nyawn, stretch\n"
