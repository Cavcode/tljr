Secondly you will find that when you buy an item the price of the next one will go up by about ten credits. And thus when you sell your stock each sale then decreases in value by roughly ten credits. so if you stand to make two hundred credits prophit from a sale.. do the math and work out the ideal amount to buy for this sale.\n\nShops\n\nOwning a shop is a big step for any trader, firstly you will need to buy the stock you wish to sell at your shop and then Enter them into your shops database ((put items in chest)). Secondly you want to decide how much you want to sell or buy stuff for at your shop. \n\nKnown Issues: If you remove items from your shop ((if you take items out the chest)) Make sure that you dont leave empty gaps in the database.. because when the sytem then tries to compress your stock to fill the gaps it can result in deletion of those items. (( When you remove stuff from the chest make sure to then take EVERYTHING out and put them back in from page 1 so they automaticly go into the next availerble free slot. if you dont do this and just leave empty gaps it can result in your items losing there Infinate stat and then disapearing once someone buys it.))\n\nSelling Markup: This determines how much you will sell your items for. Guild regulations state that you must sell within twenty and one hundred percent. Twenty meaning your items will sell for cheap. One hundred meaning you will make alot of money.. if people buy them that is.\n\nPurchasing Markdown: This determines how much your shop will buy items for. Guild Regulations state that this must rest between ten and eighty percent of the original value.. Ten meaning your shop will buy stuff for less then its worth.. Eighty Meaning your shop will most likely buy stuff for more then its worth.\n\nKnown Issues: Some shope owners have been known to have their shop go into debt due to having their markup set at Twenty percent and their Markdown set at Eighty percent. If this happends then you can buy an item from your shop and then sell it right back for more.. meaning that some people will abuse your kindness and bankrupt you. The guild has decided that if this happends it is your own fault because you have been warned about it.\n\nMaximum Sell Price: This will idicate how much your shop will buy an item for you may wish to let people sell stuff to your shop for a high price because then they are likely to buy stuff from your shop while they are there. or you may wish to not buy stuff at all.\n\nKnown Issues: Due to system resets ((server resets)) this value can sometimes get scrambled in the mainframe and then reset so that your shop keeper has on his moniter that he can buy stuff for up to ten thousand credits.. this in turn could lose you alot of credits. so make sure after you reset your system to reset your maximum buy price even if it still says what you set it too.\n\nBy Melafis Nula'ant"
