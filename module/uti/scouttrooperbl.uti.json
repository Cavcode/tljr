Clone scout troopers of the 41st Elite Legion were also known to carry these weapons during the latter stages of the Clone Wars.\n\nThis compact, one-handed blaster is fitted with a side-mounted targeting scope and phase amplifier, and featured a miniature gas cell on the rear. The weapon had a short-range barrel. Scout troopers commonly carry these weapons in a boot holster. Because scout troopers wore padded gloves, the pistol has a pressure-sensitive stock rather than a trigger. The trooper is able to grip the stock with two gloved fingers through the enlarged finger guard. "
