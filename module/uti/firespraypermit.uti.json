As a prisoner transport, the ship features numerous holding cells and devices made for the most exotic of creatures. A trademark of the ship is that it lands horizontally with the drive engines facing the surface and the cockpit facing upward. To transition to normal flight mode, the ship rotates so that the cockpit faces forward while the drive engines face rearward.\n\nThe stock ship is well armed and armored for its size, with on-board storage space and room for several passengers and/or cargo. Roughly as fast as Koensayr's Y-wing starfighter/bomber, the ship has more than enough speed and maneuverability to intercept smugglers and other renegades. It is also more famously known as the ship used by the bounty hunter Jango Fett and later on, his son Boba Fett."
