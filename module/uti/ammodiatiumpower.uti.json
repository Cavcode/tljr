This greatly conserves the energy of a diatium power cell, but now and then it still needs replacement. Due to the power cell's natural recharging abilities (recharge socket usually required), makes it ideal for a melee weapon such as a lightsaber. If assembled correctly, power cell should last indefinitely and require no further maintenance from the operator."
