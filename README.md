# Tutorials

This section is provided for team members, or any potential contributors, in case they are not familiar with the tools we are using or what an effective work flow looks like.  If you're a seasoned developer or contributor, feel free to continue using your own processes.  You don't need permission to fork the repository and ask to contibute something.  If you don't know how to fork the repository, [check out our installation tools tutorial](docs/tools.md/#github-account).

## Development Tools

[Read the Tool Installation Tutorial](docs/tools.md)

For anyone that doesn't already have a development environment set on their machines, the [tool installation tutorial](docs/tools.md) will walk you through setting up the minimum tools you should have to enable an efficent development workflow.  You can develop without these tools, however, you will likely find that using them will save you countless hours of unnecessary work over the course of this module's development.  Also, any work you create that you cannot add to the repository yourself is creating unnecessary work for another member of the team.  So, live them, learn them, love them.  They really do save time.

## Workflow

[Read the Workflow Tutorial](docs/workflow.md)

The whole purpose of setting up these tools is to create an efficient development environment.  To that end, the workflow tutorial will walk you through using the various tools you installed in the tool installation tutorial and provide the foundation for quickly creating and deploying new content.

## Letting the team know about issues with the module

[Coming soon! ~~Read the Issues tutorial~~](docs/issues.md)

This is for team members and players.  For players, you can submit bugs you find in-game.  For team members, you can request help with issues and attach those request to specific files in a pull request.  If you're not familiar with the Issues functionality on GitHub, [this tutorial](docs/issues.md) is for you.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, create a fork off this repository.  Any work you do will automatically be saved to the appropriate folder when you `nasher unpack` your saved work.  The only except to this is scripts.  New scripts will be saved to the `module` base folder so they're easy to find.
